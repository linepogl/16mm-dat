nDon't Move, Improve
tDon’t Move, Improve was a British daytime television series on ITV, which was about helping homeowners realise their dream property might be nearer than they think … they might actually be living in it. It ran for two series on ITV and a third, and final series on Discovery Real Time with new presenter, Nick Young.\n\nThe series was about showing people how to identify the potential of their home and, with expert help, made them realise they can get what they want by staying put.\n\nAlison Cork and Michael Holmes assessed the homeowners’ present property and suggested two options of how they could renovate their house to meet their family’s needs.\n\nThe show then followed the highs and lows of the renovation process. Then, Alison and Michael return to see if the homeowners have followed their advice and discovered the true potential of their home.\n\nIn 2006, ITV sold the rights to Discovery Real Time and the channel then showed an entire re-run of the show. In 2007, the show was re-designed and the third series aired with new presenter Nick Young. A fourth series was planned, but with a recession gripping Britain, plans were scrapped.
