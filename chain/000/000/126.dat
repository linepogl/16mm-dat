tUnsolved Mysteries is an American television program, hosted by Robert Stack from 1987 until 2002 and later by Dennis Farina starting in 2008. In addition, TV presenter Keely Shaye Smith and actress Virginia Madsen contributed greatly to its success. Keely Shaye played the role of a reporter from the confines of an office interacting with Stack and responding to questions for further information. In this capacity, she was a welcomed addition to the cast and revered tremendously by Stack, who would "cut to" her for more detailed information. Academy-award-winning actress Virginia Madsen's contribution to the show included performing in Stack's role as announcer for several years. It was broadcast first as specials in 1987, then as a regular series on NBC, CBS, Lifetime and Spike. Lifetime once again airs the revived version of the series, but only in reruns.\n\nAlthough the show is not in current production, Cosgrove-Meurer Productions maintains a website for the show, featuring popular accounts and still unsolved crimes, with a link to an online form should a viewer have information on an unsolved crime.
