nESPN National Hockey Night
tESPN National Hockey Night was ESPN's weekly television broadcasts of National Hockey League regular season games and coverage of playoff games, broadcast from 1992 to 2004. ESPN had been slated to broadcast games for the 2004–05 NHL season, but the season's cancellation combined with the NHL reaching an agreement with OLN to broadcast games for the 2005–06 NHL season effectively ended National Hockey Night after the 2003–04 NHL season.
