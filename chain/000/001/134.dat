tBeat the Boss is a BBC TV programme in the UK, presented by Cameron Johnson and previously Saira Khan. Two teams, one kids team named "The Bright Sparks", and one adult team named "The Big Shots", have to create a product that will appeal to the kid's market. At the end of each episode, a panel of kids vote for their favourite product and the team with the most votes wins a limousine ride home while the losers take the bus. The show has been commissioned for a fifth series to be made in Manchester.
