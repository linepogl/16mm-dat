tFrisky Dingo is an American animated cartoon series created by Adam Reed and Matt Thompson for Adult Swim. The series revolved around the conflict between a supervillain named Killface and a superhero named Awesome X, alias billionaire Xander Crews, and much of the show's humor focuses on parodying superhero and action movie clich√©s. It debuted on October 16, 2006 and ended its first season on January 22, 2007; the second season premiered on August 26, 2007 and ended on March 23, 2008. A third season was in development, but in the absence of a renewal contract from Adult Swim, pre-production ceased. The production company itself, 70/30 Productions, subsequently went out of business in January 2009.\n\nA spin-off show, The Xtacles, premiered on November 9, 2008, but only two episodes were aired prior to the production company's closure.
