nWeekends with Maury and Connie
z2006
tWeekends with Maury and Connie was an MSNBC television news series featuring light-hearted take on news of the week.\n\nIt was hosted by talk show host Maury Povich and his wife, television news anchor Connie Chung. Beginning in early 2006, it appeared every weekend morning on MSNBC until Dan Abrams was appointed the new General Manager of MSNBC. Due to the show's low ratings, near the bottom of the charts, Abrams canceled the show. The last broadcast aired June 17, 2006.\n\nOn the final episode, Chung, dressed in a white evening gown and writhing atop a black piano, sang a parody to the tune of "Thanks for the Memory". Video clips of the bizarre, off-key farewell performance circulated on internet video sites like YouTube, ironically viewed by more people than viewed Weekends with Maury and Connie during its run.
