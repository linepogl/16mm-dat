nAmerica This Morning
tAmerica This Morning is an American early morning television news program airing on ABC. The newscast is currently anchored by John Muller and Diana Perez, who also serve as anchors of ABC's overnight news program World News Now. Usually airing following World News Now, it features the day's headlines, live reports from Washington, D.C., national weather and airport impact forecasts, a short SportsCenter update from the late night Los Angeles-based anchors of the ESPN show to account for West Coast scores, and a regular business news segment called America's Money.\n\nThe program is broadcast live at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and is transmitted in a continuous half-hour tape delayed loop until 10:00 a.m. ET, when Good Morning America begins in the Pacific Time Zone. The program usually airs as a lead-in to local morning newscasts on most ABC stations, although in the few markets where the ABC station does not produce a morning newscast, it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately before the start of GMA.
