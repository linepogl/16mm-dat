nStar Wars live-action TV series
tThe Star Wars live-action television series is a project which has been in fluctuating stages of development at Lucasfilm since 2005, when George Lucas announced plans for a television series set between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy of Star Wars. Unlike the films, the story does not center on the Skywalker saga, but instead explores criminal and political power struggles in the aftermath of the fall of the Republic.\n\nIn 2011, Lucas stated that development has been delayed awaiting advances in technology and reduction in costs and Rick McCallum, the Star Wars and Red Tails producer then involved with the project, indicated that it would be at least another "three or four years".\n\nFollowing The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm, ABC Studios' president Paul Lee stated in early 2013 that the project was being reviewed for development.
