tPensacola: Wings of Gold is a syndicated American action/adventure drama series based at the Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida. Episodes aired in several countries outside the U.S. including Portugal, France, Sweden, South Africa, Finland, Germany, Italy, Hungary and Australia. Although set in Florida, it was largely filmed in San Diego, California, particularly at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and also at Naval Training Center San Diego, where the former administration building at the then-closed base was used as the Pensacola base headquarters.
