tSOP was a Philippine noontime music/variety show aired by GMA Network. The show airs from 12pm-3pm on Sundays. The show is broadcast from Studio 4 at the GMA Network Studios. The show title stands for "Sobrang Okey, Pare!" a Filipino expression which connotes enjoyment and appreciation of a particular thing that catches the imagination of the people. The title was coined by a group of GMA executives in early 1997 who conceptualized an interactive musical-variety show to replace the long-running GMA Supershow.\n\nSpinoffs and later forms of the show include SOP Rules, SOP Gigsters, and SOP Fully Charged.
