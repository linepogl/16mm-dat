tViva Laughlin is an American musical comedy-drama series adapted by Bob Lowry and Peter Bowker from the popular BBC British serial, Blackpool, and taking its name from the latter program's sequel, Viva Blackpool. Lowry and Bowker also served as executive producers alongside Hugh Jackman, John Palermo, Paul Telegdy and Gabriele Muccino. The latter also directed the pilot. It was filmed on location in part at the Morongo Casino Resort & Spa in Cabazon, California for most of the inside casino shots.\n\nProduced by BBC Worldwide, CBS Paramount Network Television, Sony Pictures Television and Seed Productions, the series was greenlit and given a thirteen-episode order on May 14, 2007. Excerpts from the series were aired in subsequent previews throughout the CBS telecast of the 61st Annual Tony Awards on June 10, 2007. CBS aired a preview of the pilot on October 18, 2007 following an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation before broadcasting its official season premiere on October 21, 2007 in its regular timeslot on Sunday nights at 8:00/7:00c, following 60 Minutes.\n\nCBS cancelled Viva Laughlin on October 22, 2007 after airing two episodes, with the Nine Network following suit the next day by canceling the show after airing only one episode. Both CBS and Nine filled the show's time slot with episodes of CSI, with The Amazing Race then taking Viva Laughlin's place on CBS on November 4. There are still no plans to air the remaining episodes.
