tFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAlbert (born November 26, \n1926, Boston, Massachusetts) and David Maysles (rhymes with "hazels", \nborn 10 January 1932, Boston, Massachusetts) were a documentary \nfilmmaking team whose cinéma vérité works include Salesman (1968), Gimme\n Shelter (1970) and Grey Gardens (1976). Their 1964 film on The Beatles \nforms the backbone of the DVD, The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit. \nSeveral Maysles films document art projects by Christo and Jeanne-Claude\n over a three-decade period, from 1974 when Christo's Valley Curtain was\n nominated for an Academy Award to 2005 when The Gates headlined New \nYork's Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nDavid Maysles, the younger brother,\n died of a stroke on January 3, 1987, in New York. Albert Maysles \ngraduated in 1949 with a BA from Syracuse University and later earned a \nmasters degree at Boston University. Albert has continued to make films \non his own since his brother's death. Jean-Luc Godard once called Albert\n Maysles "the best American cameraman". In 2005 Maysles was given a \nlifetime achievement award at the Czech film festival AFO (Academia Film\n Olomouc). He is working on his own autobiographical documentary.\n\nIn\n 2005 he founded the Maysles Institute, a nonprofit organization that \nprovides training and apprenticeships to underprivileged individuals. \nAlbert is a patron of Shooting People, a filmmakers' community.\n\nDescription\n above from the Wikipedia article Albert and David Maysles, licensed \nunder CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.
