t​From IMDb;\nAngel Salazar (born March 2, 1956) is a Cuban-American comedian and actor.\n \n  This manic,human laugh factory is rather difficult to describe. His Cuban heritage and penchant for sporting mini-skirts notwithstanding, Salazar's performance is a mixture of street-smart ethnic wisecracks, risqué humor, physical comedy, and audience involvement.  \n  He disappeared from films in 1993 for a decade!? Only appearing in a documentary called "Comedian"(2002) in between. He reappeared in 2003 in the films, "Harlem Blues"and "Vote for Me". He once again disappeared for 2 yrs from film!?. In 2005, he came back for a film called "Rose Woes and Joe's " But then he once again vanished for 2 more years!? In between he did another documentary in 2006 "The Latin Legends of Comedy" with J.J. Ramirez and Joey Vega.He reappeared in 2007 with "Made in Brooklyn " then again gone for 2 more years!?  \n  He again appeared in 2009 and made one short film,'Trust Me'. Then the very next year 2010 he did another short film, 'Crumble' with his co-star from "Scarface"(1983), Steven Bauer.  \n  He came back to films in 2011 with "The Last Gamble "as a character named 'Angel' no-less.
