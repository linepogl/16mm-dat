tHave I Got News for You is a British television panel show produced by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC. It is based loosely on the BBC Radio 4 show The News Quiz, and has been regularly broadcast since 1990. The show has cultivated a reputation for sailing close to the wind in matters of libel with its topical and satirical remit.\n\nHave I Got News for You is often cited as beginning the increasing domination of panel shows in British TV comedy, and remains one of the genre's key standard-bearers. In recognition of this, the show received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2011 British Comedy Awards. It was the first time the honour had been bestowed upon a collective instead of an individual or double act.\n\n44 complete series of the programme have been broadcast. For its first 10 years, the programme was shown on BBC Two. In 2000, it switched over to BBC One. The UKTV channel Dave carries regular repeats of the show.
