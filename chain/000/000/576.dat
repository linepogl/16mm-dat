tESPNews Gametime is a news/analysis and up to the minute highlight show that airs on ESPNews. Debuting on September 5, 2006, the program aired Monday-Sunday from 8pm ET-12am ET and Friday from 9pm ET-12am ET. On Fridays, it was pushed back one hour to make room for Football Friday. Gametime, as they call it for short, replaced ESPNews Early Evening, which is regular news and highlights. ESPNews Gametime was made up of 30-minute blocks throughout the program.\n\nDuring the show, the two anchors for that night updated scores, highlights and were joined by analysts to discuss different topics, show live postgame press conferences and player comments, were joined by players via phone and go over all of the top stories of the day.\n\nOn 2008-03-31, the 11-11:30pm ET block of Gametime was replaced by The Highlight Zone, a new program devoted to sports highlights and scores, similar to FSN's Final Score.\n\nESPNews Gametime was discontinued after January 2, 2009 as ESPNews reverted to half-hour blocks throughout the day beginning January 5, 2009.
