tGlobal Village is an Australian television show broadcast by the Australian public broadcaster SBS. The program is hosted by Silvio Rivier, who also does many of the voice overs. In 2008 it combined with Thalassa, a French documentary series, to expand its coverage of coastal areas.\n\nGlobal Village covers communities from all over the globe. The show consists of usually two, mostly short films 10â€“15 minutes long describing land and people all across the world. About 50% come from a French TV station and thus deal with topics from France, or, less frequently, its former colonies.\n\nThe main focus is to educate viewers about different cultures and working styles from around the world. Global Village has released two music CDs which contain a selection of music taken from the countries they visit.
