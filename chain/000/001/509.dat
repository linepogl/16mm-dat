tHope & Faith is an American sitcom, starring Faith Ford and Kelly Ripa. It originally aired on ABC from September 26, 2003 to May 2, 2006. During the first and second seasons, the series was part of a revived TGIF comedy block.\n\nThe series followed Hope Shanowski, a homemaker living with her husband Charlie and three children. Faith Fairfield is Hope's sister and a soap opera star whose character was killed off, leading her to move in with Hope's family.\n\nThe series was loosely based in part on the life of its creator, Joanna Johnson, a former cast member of The Bold and the Beautiful. The series was primarily filmed at New York City's Silvercup East, a sister studio to Silvercup Studios.\n\nIn May 2006, ABC announced that Hope & Faith had been cancelled after three seasons.
