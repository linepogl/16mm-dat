tThe Knights of Prosperity is an American comedy series that premiered on ABC in the United States on Wednesday, January 3, 2007. It was created by Rob Burnett and Jon Beckerman, who also created the NBC comedy-drama Ed. The show follows a group of misfits—the titular Knights—who attempt to rob various celebrities, the first being Mick Jagger. Later in the series, the attempt to rob his luxury apartment failed, and the team moved onto new targets Kelly Ripa and later Ray Romano. The series was made by the creators' company B&B, Worldwide Pants Incorporated and ABC Studios.\n\nThe series initially aired on Wednesdays at 9:00 p.m. before being moved to 8:30. The series was pulled after airing nine episodes and then officially canceled by ABC. On August 8, after 5 months off the air, ABC broadcast two episodes and then pulled the sitcom once again. On August 17, 2007, the network made all 13 episodes available for viewing on ABC.com, but were later taken off.
