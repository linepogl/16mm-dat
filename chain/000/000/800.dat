tQuizmania was a popular British interactive gameshow. The show was devised by Chuck Thomas, Debbie King, and Simone Thorogood and produced by Fremantle Media for Information TV and ITV. Currently, the online revival is produced by Screen Pop Ltd. in association with Illumina Digital. In a similar vein to other premium-line call-in shows, viewers on the TV version of Quizmania were encouraged to phone a premium-rate number in order to provide an answer to a quiz question.\n\nQuizmania's most recent television broadcast was made on 14 Januaryâ€“15 January 2007, presented by Greg Scott and Debbie King. The show closed with a highlights montage and an emotional farewell sign off from Scott and King.\n\nThe series returned on Thursday 17 July 2008 as an online-only show on Quizmania's official website. Prior to official confirmation of the relaunch, rumour and hype had been escalating about the new series since December 2007 when the show's presenters and devisors were contacted about the then-possible revival.
