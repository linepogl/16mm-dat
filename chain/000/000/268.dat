tUntold Stories of the E.R. is a docudrama television series which airs on TLC and Discovery Fit & Health.\n\nIn this program real-life emergency room doctors tell about their most bizarre and puzzling cases. Typically these involve medical sabotage, violently or strangely acting patients, life-threatening injuries, or even situations in which the E.R. physician is too overwhelmed to handle the caseload and can't transfer responsibility for the patient to someone else.\n\nOften the doctors play themselves, and whenever possible the patients themselves take part in the reenactment as well. If they don't appear as themselves during their medical emergency, they are often shown in brief interviews to show the public how they turned out. Occasionally, patients' names are changed and actors play their roles. All cases are based on actual events, but are highly dramatized and not necessarily accurate from a clinical or technical standpoint.
