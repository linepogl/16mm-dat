z2007
tQuizmania was an Australian phone-in quiz show, based on the British program of the same name, and broadcast on the Nine Network in the late night time slot. The show was produced from Nine's Richmond studios in Melbourne. Its main Director was Rick Maslan.\n\nQuizmania was first broadcast live on Nine Network stations GTV, TCN, QTQ and NTD, and affiliates NBN and WIN Television on 25 July 2006. The show was unique in that it was broadcast live to South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory with the presenters welcoming all three states to the show half an hour after it started, due to all three states being thirty minutes behind the Australian east coast. Similarly during daylight saving months, Queensland viewers were welcomed an hour later when the broadcast began in that state.\n\nSometimes due to varying program schedules in each capital city or regional area, some cities and/or areas did not broadcast Quizmania while other cities and/or areas still received the broadcast.\n\nOnly contestants aged 18 or over were allowed to participate. Underage callers were a regular occurrence on the show especially during school holidays.
