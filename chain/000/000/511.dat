tBeat-Club was a German music program that ran from September 1965 to December 1972. It was broadcast from Bremen, Germany on Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen, the national public TV channel of the ARD, and produced by one of its members, Radio Bremen, later co-produced by WDR following the 38th episode. It is notable for being the first German show to be based around popular music, and featured artists such as The Equals, Grateful Dead, Zager and Evans, Cream, Frank Zappa, The Rolling Stones, Gene Pitney, Ten Years After, Rory Gallagher, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Ike & Tina Turner, The Who, Black Sabbath, Harry Nilsson, David Bowie, The Bee Gees, The Beach Boys, Chicago, The Doors, Kraftwerk and Robin Gibb in its seven-year run. In 1972, it was replaced by Musikladen.\n\nPerformances from the show can now be seen on VH1 Classic, and reruns air in several European countries. Several DVD collections have also been released.\n\nIn early 2008, the first free Video on demand web portal for Beat-Club and Musikladen was launched at Mybeatclub.com, featuring the most popular songs and artists of both shows. In 2010, mybeatclub.com was replaced by www.youtube.de/beatclub.
