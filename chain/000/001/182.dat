nBig Brother Nigeria
tBig Brother Nigeria was a reality TV show based on the Big Brother TV series in which 12 contestants live in an isolated house and compete for a large cash prize worth $100000 at the end of the show by avoiding being evicted by viewers. A collaboration between Nigerian and South African production teams, it aired on DStv Channel 37 from March 5 to June 4, 2006.\n\nIn a twist to the game, two new contestants were introduced on Day 23, much to the excitement of the remaining house mates.\n\nEbuka, the most popular house mate for several weeks into the show and widely believed to emerge winner was the seventh house mate to be evicted; many viewers blame the overzealous Joe's Fan Club for his eviction. Joe himself was soon evicted as a result of the perceived arrogance and exuberance of his fans who turned viewers against him.\n\nBig Brother added another twist to the game on day 79 by canceling the day's scheduled nominations and making the house mates believe they will instead be evicted based on their performances on assigned tasks while in reality no more evictions were held and viewers began voting for the winner who turned out to be 26 year old Katung Aduwak.\n\nThe voting results were verified by the auditing company of Alexander-Forbes.
