tBrides of Christ was an Australian television miniseries produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1991.\n\nThe series takes place behind the walls of a Sydney convent school and deals with the struggles of both the Roman Catholic nuns and the young students to adapt to the many social changes taking place within the church and the outside world during the 1960s.\n\nSix fifty-minute episodes were made. Each episode focused on a particular story and set of characters. Some characters would appear in multiple episodes with varying levels of prominence from episode to episode. Lead characters in one episode might appear in a support role in another episode. Josephine Byrnes' character was the focus of both the first and last episodes.\n\nIn her first major role, Naomi Watts starred as Frances, one of the students. One episode also guest starred the then-unknown Russell Crowe as a young man distressed about being called up for the Vietnam War.\n\nThe series was filmed on location at St Mary's Tower's, Douglas Park, New South Wales, Santa Sabina College, Strathfield, New South Wales and St Scholastica's College, Glebe, New South Wales.\n\nThe entire series has since been released on DVD.
