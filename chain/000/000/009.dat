z1999
tThe Match Game is an American television panel game show in which contestants attempted to match celebrities' answers to fill-in-the-blank questions. The precise format of the show varied through five runs on American television: 1962 to 1969, 1973 to 1982, 1983 to 1984, 1990 to 1991 and 1998 to 1999. Most American incarnations of the show have been hosted by Gene Rayburn.\n\nThe most famous versions of the 1970s and 1980s, starting with Match Game '73, are remembered for their bawdy and sometimes rowdy humor involving contestants trying to match six celebrities. The series has been franchised around the world, often under the name Blankety Blank.\n\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked it #4 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever.
