tSpider! was a musical children's television series made by Hibbert Ralph Entertainment for the BBC which originally aired in 1991. It followed the adventures of a spider, the protagonist, and a young boy. The stories were told through song, performed by Jeff Stevenson with his children, Casey and Holly, singing backing vocals. The style of music varies from rock 'n' roll to haunting and melancholic, and was produced by Rick Cassman. A BBC Video entitled "Spider! - I'm Only Scary 'cos I'm Hairy!" which contained all 13 episodes was released soon after the series ended. A DVD version was also released later.
