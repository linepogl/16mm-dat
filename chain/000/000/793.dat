nMy New Best Friend
tMy New Best Friend is a British Comedy broadcast on Channel 4 during 2003. The idea was a hidden camera show where a member of the public would enter into an agreement to be filmed for a whole weekend with the task of convincing their friends and family a character being played by Marc Wootton was their new best friend. Their reward being a prize of £10,000. What made the game difficult was Marc's character constantly embarrassing them in front of their family and friends to extreme levels, but they had to agree and go along to everything he said. Marc Wootton's characters were chosen for different episodes to make them as different from the contestant as possible to make it difficult for their friends and family to be convinced.\n\nOnce they have made it through the weekend the cameras capture the moment where Marc gives them the money and leaves the scene. The contestant is left to explain the whole situation was a TV program and a game to win £10,000 to their friends and family.\n\nMy New Best Friend won the Rose D'or Golden Rose Award at Montreux and a British Comedy Award for Best New TV Comedy
