nClub Mario
tDuring reruns that played during the summer of 1990, Club Mario replaced the Mario Brothers' sitcom segments on The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!. This format featured "extreme" Mario-obsessed teenagers goofing around, and in at least one episode, running around the DiC studios and harassing Andy Heyward. Mr. Coombs and Miss Delany played siblings Tommy and Tammy Treehugger, respectively. Michael plays Cool MC and his evil twin brother Eric, who time and again attempts to take over the show, usually uttering the phrase "dis'a MY show!". An additional added segment was a one-to-two-minute viewing of Space Scout Theater/Spaced Out Theater, hosted by Princess Centauri, a green alien woman, which was sourced and edited from the science fiction children television series, Photon.\n\nCast of Club Mario:\n\n⁕Chris Coombs as Tommy Treehugger\n\n⁕Michael Anthony Rawlins as Co-MC\n\n⁕Michael Anthony Rawlins as Evil Eric\n\n⁕Kurt Weldon as Dr. Know-It-All\n\n⁕Victoria Delaney as Tammy Treehugger\n\n⁕Jeff Rose as The Big Kid\n\n⁕James Abbott as The Band\n\n⁕Shanti Kahn as Princess Centauri\n\n⁕Andy Heyward as himself
