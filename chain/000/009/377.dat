tEntertainers with Byron Allen is a television magazine interview series hosted by Byron Allen which usually airs in low-profile weekend timeslots in syndication, such as early afternoons against competing sports events on other stations a television station knows they will not compete well against, or in overnight periods.\n\nThe show typically takes place with Allen doing a short introduction of his guests, then showing interview footage of a celebrity at a press junket, along with clips of the film being promoted. Athletes are also interviewed, usually in practice or home settings. Music videos are also shown to fill out time towards the end of the program. The program was previously known as Entertainment Studios, named after Allen's network of websites encompassing his various other syndicated programs, which is the present name for the production company run by Allen that produces the program.
