oDer Lauf der Dinge
tArtists Peter Fischli and David Weiss create the ultimate Rube Goldberg machine with a complex imaginative devices that trigger each other for 30 minutes in a domino effect. The film was creating in an empty warehouse and with objects probably found at a junkyard as the creative contraptions fly, burn, roll, walk, melt, pop, push and fall in an endless science project that will mesmerize the mind.
