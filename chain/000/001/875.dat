tSons & Daughters is an American situation comedy about an extended blended family living close together in a neighborhood. The producers, creator Fred Goss, Lorne Michaels, and Nick Holly, flavored the show with a mixed atmosphere of improvisational and scripted humor. The show premiered on March 7, 2006 on ABC. The show is produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal Television. It was canceled in late April 2006 after 10 episodes aired, leaving one unaired episode.\n\nThe whole series was aired on the Seven Network in Australia, including the final previously unaired episode, ending on August 6, 2007. Coincidentally, the Seven Network also screened the earlier Australian soap opera of the same name. In December 2010, ITV1 started showing the series in the United Kingdom for the first time, over four years since its American showing. The show has also been aired on TV3 in Ireland.\n\nThere are currently no plans to release Sons & Daughters on DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment.
