tAs Told by Ginger is an American animated series aimed at preteens and teenagers that was produced by Klasky-Csupo and aired on Nickelodeon.

Most episodes also feature a subplot focused on Carl Foutley, Ginger's brother. The series was noted for the fact that it had ongoing story arcs and characters who developed and aged in real time. As Told by Ginger ended production on 2003, although some episodes were not aired on U.S. television until 2009.
