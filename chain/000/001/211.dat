nSquawk on the Street
tSquawk on the Street, which debuted on December 19, 2005, is a business show on CNBC that follows the first 90 minutes of trading on Wall Street in the United States.\n\nOriginally airing as a one-hour program, the show doubled its airtime to two hours on July 19, 2007. This replaced the first hour of Morning Call, which aired one hour later and had its airtime reduced in half. On October 17, 2011, Squawk on the Street was expanded to 3 hours, from 9am to noon ET. The Call was canceled as a result of this program's expansion.
