nFord Super Sunday
tFord Super Sunday is Sky Sports' flagship live association football programme, broadcasting live Premier League football on most Sundays over the course of a season. The main live game will typically kick off at 4pm, often following a 1.30pm game, on Sky Sports 1.\n\nIt had been presented since its debut in August 1992 by former TV-am host Richard Keys, alongside a variety of guest match pundits until January 2011. From the 2005â€“06 season, former Liverpool player Jamie Redknapp joined Keys as a regular pundit. The commentary team of Martin Tyler and former Scotland striker Andy Gray became synonymous with Sky's football coverage until Gray was sacked in January 2011, although other commentators may be used. In April 2011, former Manchester United defender Gary Neville was confirmed as his replacement.
