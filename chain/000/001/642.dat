tSpicks and Specks was an Australian music-themed comedic television quiz show. It aired on ABC1 at 8:30 on Wednesday nights, with the show repeated on Thursdays on ABC2 at 8pm. The previous year's season was repeated every Friday at 2:30 pm on ABC1. It was filmed at ABC Melbourne's Gordon Street studios.\n\nThe show was hosted by stand-up comedian Adam Hills who posed questions to two teams each headed by a permanent team captain, actor/comedian Alan Brough and Mildura-raised radio announcer Myf Warhurst. They each had two guest panelists, generally one from the world of music and one from comedy. They varied from week to week, but regular guests included Hamish Blake, Tim Minchin, Frank Woodley, Colin Lane, Ross Noble, James Morrison, Ren√©e Geyer, Ella Hooper, Meshel Laurie, Denise Scott, Megan Washington and Dave O'Neil. Blake appeared more often than any other guest panelist, and his comparative lack of musical knowledge was a running gag.\n\nThe overall style employing a mix of music and comedy was similar to the British show Never Mind the Buzzcocks and fellow Australian TV show Rockwiz, but the question formats and show style are different.\n\nThe show returned for a seventh season on 4 May 2011. On 25 May 2011, it was announced the seventh season would be the final season and the show would end on 23 November 2011.
