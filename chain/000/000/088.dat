tAs Time Goes By is a British romantic sitcom that aired on BBC One from 1992 to 2002, with reunion specials in 2005. Starring Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer, it follows the relationship between two former lovers who meet unexpectedly after not having been in contact for 38 years.\n\nThe programme's original working title had been Winter with Flowers but was changed during its first day of filming due to the cast's protestations. The new title was taken from the 1931 song "As Time Goes By", which was used as the title music, recorded by Joe Fagin.\n\nThe show was created by Colin Bostock-Smith, but written by Bob Larbey, who had co-written The Good Life. In 2004, As Time Goes By came 29th in Britain's Best Sitcom.\n\nThe series was produced by Theatre of Comedy Entertainment, in association with DLT Entertainment Ltd. for the BBC.
