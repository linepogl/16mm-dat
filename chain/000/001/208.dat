nCaptain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years
tCaptain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years is an animated science fiction television series produced by Harmony Gold USA. The series was created by Carl Macek by combining footage from Leiji Matsumoto’s Captain Harlock and Queen Millennia anime series.\n\nThis is the second time the 1978 Captain Harlock series was treated for English language distribution. The first attempt was in 1981 with the lesser known Ziv International, who only released two volumes of two episodes each, the first a relatively faithful adaptation, the second retooling the approach to a more farcical one. This attempt is often confused with the Harmony Gold production, but the two productions are not related.\n\nThe plot of Macek’s creation has no relation to Matsumoto’s works.
