tLarry King Live is an American talk show that was hosted by Larry King on CNN from 1985 to 2010. It was CNN's most watched and longest-running program, with over one million viewers nightly.\n\nMainly aired from CNN's Los Angeles studios, the show was sometimes broadcast from CNN's studios in New York or Washington, D.C., where King gained national prominence during his years as a radio interviewer for the Mutual Broadcasting System. Every night, King interviewed one or more prominent individuals, usually celebrities, politicians and businesspeople.\n\nThe one-hour show was broadcast three times a day in some areas, and was seen all over the world on CNN International.\n\nOn June 29, 2010, King announced that the program would be coming to an end. The "final edition" of the program aired on December 16, but a new episode on the war against cancer aired two days later on December 18.\n\nLarry King Live was replaced by Piers Morgan Tonight, a talk show hosted by the British television personality and journalist Piers Morgan. It began airing January 17, 2011, featuring Oprah Winfrey as the first guest.
