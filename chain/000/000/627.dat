nScience Magazine
z1979
tScience Magazine was a half-hour television show produced by CBC Television from 1975 to 1979.\n\nThe show was hosted by geneticist David Suzuki, who previously hosted the daytime youth programme Suzuki On Science. Science Magazine moved beyond the youth audience and was mostly broadcast during prime time, except for occasional sessions where the show was repeated at afternoon times.\n\nThe program featured news and features on scientific research and developments. Regular items within the show included "How Things Work" and "Science Update". Jan Tennant and Cy Strange of the CBC were the program's film feature narrators.\n\nScience Magazine, as such, ended production when the CBC joined it with The Nature of Things, keeping the latter as title and Suzuki as host.
