z2007
tCastaway 2007 was a follow-up to the BBC series Castaway 2000 in which a group of people from the British public are "castaway" on a remote island. While in the 2000 series 36 men, women and children moved to a remote Scottish island for a year, this series featured 15 men and women from the British public who were moved to a New Zealand island for three months. The basic premise of a group of volunteers living as a community in a remote location remains, however this time the BBC promised an "exotic location, on the other side of the world". Another change since Castaway 2000, was that the castaways were voted off the island one-by-one, in a manner similar to other reality series like Big Brother.\n\nThe prize for the winning castaway, which was Jonathan, was a trip around New Zealand with a friend later in the year.
