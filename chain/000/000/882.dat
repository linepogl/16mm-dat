tConnections is a ten-episode documentary television series and 1978 book created, written and presented by science historian James Burke. The series was produced and directed by Mick Jackson of the BBC Science & Features Department and first aired in 1978 and 1979. It took an interdisciplinary approach to the history of science and invention and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic presentation, historical re-enactments, and intricate working models.\n\nThe popular success of the series led to the production of The Day the Universe Changed, a similar program but showing a more linear history of several important scientific developments. Years later the success in syndication led to two sequels, Connections² and Connections³, both for TLC. In 2004, KCSM-TV produced a program called Re-Connections, consisting of an interview of Burke and highlights of the original series, for the 25th anniversary of the first broadcast in the USA on PBS.
