tTake Hart is a British children's television show about art, presented by Tony Hart. It took over from Vision On, and ran from 1977 until 1983. The show featured Hart and the animated Plasticine character Morph, and other characters created by David Sproxton like 'Smoulder the Moulder', which was a lump of mould which would create props by 'spraying' them out of a spray can. The only other human to appear on a regular basis was Mr Bennett, the caretaker, played by Colin Bennett. The programme won a BAFTA award for Hart in 1984.\n\nAs well as demonstrating small-scale projects, Hart also created large-scale artworks on the TV studio floor, and even used beaches and other open spaces as 'canvases'. This idea was later adopted by Art Attack.\n\nA regular feature of the show was 'The Gallery', which displayed artworks sent in by young viewers. The easy-listening vibraphone music accompanying this feature - "Left Bank Two", composed by Wayne Hill - has passed into British TV musical lore. In later series, "Left Bank Two" alternated with John Williams' recording of "Cavatina", which is also well-remembered by many viewers.
