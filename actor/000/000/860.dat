tEve was born just north of San Francisco in Mill Valley and was  interested in show business from an early age. At 16, she made her stage  debut after quitting school to joined a stock company. After appearing  in minor roles in two films under her real name, Eunice Quedens, she  found that the stage offered her the same minor roles. By the mid 30s,  one of these minor roles would attract notice as a comedy sketch in the  stage play "Ziegfeld Folies". By that time, she had changed her name to  Eve Arden. In 1937, she attracted some attention with a small role in Oh, Doctor (1937) which led to her being cast in a minor role in the film Stage Door  (1937). By the time the film was finished, her part had expanded into  the wise-cracking, fast-talking friend to the lead. She would play  virtually the character for most of her career. While her sophisticated  wise-cracking would never make her the lead, she would be a busy actress  in dozens of movies over the next dozen years. In At the Circus (1939), she was the acrobatic Peerless Pauline opposite Groucho Marx and the Russian sharp shooter in the comedy The Doughgirls (1944). For her role as Ida in Mildred Pierce  (1945), she received an Academy Award nomination. Famous for her quick  ripostes, this led to work in Radio during the 40s. In 1948, CBS Radio  premiered "Our Miss Brooks", which would be the perfect show for her  character. As her film career began to slow, CBS would take the popular  radio show to television in 1952. The television series Our Miss Brooks (1952) would run through 1956 and led to he movie Our Miss Brooks (1956). When the show ended, she tried another television series, The Eve Arden Show  (1957), but it was soon canceled. In the 60s, Eve raised a family and  did a few guest roles, until her come-back television series The Mothers-In-Law (1967). This show, co-starring Kaye Ballard  ran for two seasons. After that, she would make more unsold pilots, a  couple of television movies and a few guest shots. She returned in  occasional cameo appearances including the Principal McGee in Grease (1978), and Warden June in Pandemonium (1982), showing that she still had the wise-cracks and screen presence to bring back the fond memories of Miss Connie Brooks.\n\nDate of Death  12 November  1990  , Los Angeles, California   (cardiac arrest due to arteriosclerotic heart disease)
