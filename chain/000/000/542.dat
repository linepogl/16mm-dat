tStrictly Dance Fever is a British television programme, broadcast on BBC One on Saturday evenings. It was an amateur dance talent competition, hosted by Graham Norton, which ran during Spring 2005 and Spring 2006. It was, in many ways, similar to the BBC's popular Strictly Come Dancing, a celebrity based dance contest also broadcast on Saturday evenings. On 12 December 2006, the BBC announced that Strictly Dance Fever had been axed in favour of the Andrew Lloyd Webber talent search, How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?.
