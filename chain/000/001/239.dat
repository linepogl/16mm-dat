nBug Alert
tBug Alert is a British Children's television series, first shown on GMTV in 1996. It featured the antics of a range of bug-like characters who lived in the kitchen of an unnamed house. These creatures apparently only came out when the resident humans were "not about." In the third and final series the characters moved out of the house and opened a somewhat seedy restaurant where they set about serving Weasel Curry to their regular clientele. 78 episodes were made in total and are repeated regularly on GMTV.\n\nAfter the first two series the show format was bought by Channel 4 which commissioned 26 further episodes. These, and the previous series, were aired in their weekend morning slot. The show was characterised by its somewhat adult references and themes, most of which went way above the heads of watching children.\n\nThe 78 30-minute scripts were co-written by the director Peter Eyre and the main puppeteer, Francis Wright. The executive producer was Catherine Robins of Two Sides TV.
