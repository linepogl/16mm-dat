tStrictly Come Dancing is a British television show, featuring celebrities with professional dance partners competing in Ballroom and Latin dances. The title of the show suggests a continuation of the long-running series Come Dancing, with an allusion to the film Strictly Ballroom. The format has been exported to over 40 other countries, and has also inspired a modern-dance themed spin-off Strictly Dance Fever.\n\nThe show has run on BBC One since 15 May 2004, primarily on Saturday evenings with a following Sunday night results show. The 9th series ended on 17 December 2011 and the first competitive show of the 10th series was on 5 October 2012. A further nine stand-alone Christmas Specials have also been produced, in consecutive years from 2004 to 2010. Six charity specials have also been produced. Since the fourth series, the show has also been aired in high definition on BBC HD and BBC One HD from series 8.
