nPower Lunch
tPower Lunch is a television business news program on CNBC, airing between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. Eastern Time. It is presented by Tyler Mathisen, Sue Herera, and Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. Simon Hobbs will fill in on occasion. Bill Griffeth anchored the program alone from 1996 to 2002. Caruso-Cabrera joined the program as Griffeth's original co-presented from February 4, 2002, to December 5, 2003, before being replaced by Herera starting on December 8, 2003. Caruso-Cabrera and Dennis Kneale appeared on the show regularly in their respective analyst capacities until both became full co-presenters in 2009. Mathisen joined the program in late 2009, after Griffeth's leave of absence began. Power Lunch used to air for two hours until June 7, 2010, when it moved to 1 ET and had its running time cut in half, from 2 hours to 1 hour, to make room for The Strategy Session at noon ET and the Fast Money Halftime Report at 12:30 ET.
