tNewsEdge at 11:00 was an 11:00–11:35 p.m. newscast on WTVT hosted by Mark Wilson. It is described as a fast-paced, Fox News Channel-type news show, with shorter report segments, and a more tabloid-feel.\n\nThe newscast is split into multiple parts, which mainly are: "Top Stories", "48 Hour Forecast", "FOX Up Front", "FloridaEdge", "NationalEdge", "FOX Focus", "WeatherEdge", "SportsEdge", and "The Lightning Round".\n\n"The Lightning Round" is a 5-minute debate–opinion segment which features the host, the meteorologist, and the sports anchor, along with a "special guest", debating somewhat controversial news topics.\n\nNewsEdge was, and still is somewhat, considered independent from WTVT's main news operation, and at one point, NewsEdge had different graphics and a different theme than the main news operation until the NewsEdge graphics and theme were integrated into the main news operation in February 2006. Fox Television Stations Group, which owns WTVT, designated Tampa as the test market for the new 11:00 p.m. newscast format. It has since expanded the NewsEdge branding to WTTG Washington, DC and WJBK Detroit, Michigan for their 11:00 newscasts, as well as KTBC in Austin, Texas, which uses the NewsEdge branding for all of its newscasts.
