nMum's on Strike
tMum's on Strike was a daytime programme on ITV.\n\nEach programme features two families. The mother of the house heads off in a limo for a weekend of pampering, leaving father in charge. The mum will remove the one item from the house she reckons stops him pulling his weight in the first place.\n\nThe mums leave a list of chores that need doing, and so the dad will really appreciate her work load she won't have stocked up on food over the last week, or done the laundry.\n\nOn day two, the dad has to face a task their partner reckons he's always avoided in the past. It might be taking all three youngsters shopping for school shoes, or preparing a picnic and taking them out for an activity day.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the health spa, the mums are able to watch film of their partners' efforts.\n\nAfter the two days are up, the mums go back home to their partners and children. Then, one family out of the two wins a prize.
