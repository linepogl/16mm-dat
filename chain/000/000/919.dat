tCharlie Rose is an American television interview show, with Charlie Rose as executive producer, executive editor, and host. The show is syndicated on PBS and is owned by Charlie Rose, LLC. Rose interviews thinkers, writers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, businesspersons, leaders, scientists, and other newsmakers.\n\nThe show premiered on September 30, 1991. It is presented by WNET, where it first aired as a local program.\n\nFunding for the show is primarily provided by donations from various corporations and charitable foundations. The show has been criticized for not disclosing the list of donors even if the show is considered "public" broadcasting.\n\nIn 2007, the video archive of past interviews was added to the website for free viewing. In a partnership with Google, nearly 4000 hours of video was added to Google Video including complete hour-long episodes as they originally aired. The videos are now unavailable after Google Video shut down.
