tEd, Edd n Eddy is a Canadian-American animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci and produced by Canada-based a.k.a. Cartoon. It premiered on Cartoon Network on January 4, 1999. The series was designed to resemble classic cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s, and revolves around three adolescent boys, Ed, Edd "Double D", and Eddy, collectively known as "the Eds", who live in a suburban cul-de-sac. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail though, leaving them in various predicaments.\n\nAdult cartoonist Antonucci was dared to create a children's cartoon; while designing a commercial, he conceived Ed, Edd n Eddy, and approached Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon with the series, but both channels demanded creative control, to which Antonucci did not agree. A deal was ultimately made for Cartoon Network to commission Ed, Edd n Eddy, after they agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show. During the show's run, several specials and shorts were produced in addition to the regular television series. Two books, as well as several comic books and video games, either based on the series or featuring the series' characters have also been produced. The series' TV movie finale, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.
