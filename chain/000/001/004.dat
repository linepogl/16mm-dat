z2007
tCinematech was a TV show on G4 and G4techTV that showcases various cutscenes and trailers for video games past, present, and upcoming. Some of the cut scenes are outros, which only people who have played through the game would have been able to see. Some of this footage comes from the interns of X-Play, who had to play through the game for the X-Play review. The show has neither a host nor any narration. A new version of the show, entitled Cinematech: Nocturnal Emissions, was shown during the Midnight Spank block. In addition, some episodes of Cinematech have been devoted to classic games and how much they are worth today.
