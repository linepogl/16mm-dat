tUnder One Roof is a 2002 U.S. reality show on the UPN network. Hosted by Rob Nelson, the show's premise was to pit five families against each other to win a Fijian beachfront house.\n\nUPN has been criticized for having canceled the show, not once, but twice. After the first two episodes, aired in March and April, fared poorly in the ratings, the show was cancelled, then brought back again in July as a summer replacement, only to be pulled from the air again after airing one more episode.\n\nBecause of the cancellation, the winning family of the house was never publicly revealed, although it is known that the Skofields won.\n\nThe five families that competed were:\n\n⁕The Distels\n\n⁕The Paganis\n\n⁕The McRaes\n\n⁕The Hatmakers\n\n⁕The Skofields
