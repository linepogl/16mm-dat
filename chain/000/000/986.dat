z2000
tThe New Batman/Superman Adventures is a name given to a package series that combined Superman: The Animated Series with The New Batman Adventures produced by Warner Bros. Animation. It aired from 1997â€“2000 on Kids' WB. Each half-hour episode in the hour and one half block, featured either a single repeat from the original Superman run, the original Batman: The Animated Series, or a brand new story featuring Batman made specifically for this series, drawn in an animation style to match Superman: The Animated Series. These new stories focus more on Batman's supporting cast and introduce new characters such as Tim Drake. The two animated universes were united in the Superman episode "World's Finest", which tells the story of Batman and Superman's first meeting. The new Batman episodes that began airing in the Fall 1997 season were later released as a DVD box set of Batman: The Animated Series as Volume 4. New Superman episodes that later aired in the Fall 1998 season and onward are now considered to be the third season of Superman: The Animated Series.
