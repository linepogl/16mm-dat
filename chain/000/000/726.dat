tLidsville is Sid and Marty Krofft's third television show following H.R. Pufnstuf and The Bugaloos. As did its predecessors, the series combined two types of characters: conventional actors in makeup filmed alongside performers in full mascot costumes, whose voices were dubbed in post-production. Seventeen episodes aired on Saturday mornings for two seasons, 1971â€“1973. The opening was shot at Six Flags Over Texas.
