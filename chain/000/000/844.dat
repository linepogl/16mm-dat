tLine of Fire is a crime drama television series that was broadcast on ABC for 11 episodes in the winter of 2003-2004. It starred Leslie Bibb and Jeffrey D. Sams as two rookie FBI agents assigned to the bureau's Richmond, Virginia branch, where their story parallels that of a local mob boss, Jonah Malloy. When a fellow agent is murdered in a shootout with the gangsters, the head of the FBI branch declares an all-out war on the criminal underworld. The following episodes weaved intricately between Bibb and Sams' federal agency and Paymer's gang, though the two storylines rarely met head-on, except when occasionally focusing on an undercover agent. The show was canceled after just 11 episodes in June 2004, though 13 episodes in all were produced.\n\nMob boss Jonah Malloy's signature line was "That's that with that."\n\nThe Parents Television Council took a clip from the series for their TV's Worst Clips from years 2001 to 2004. The clip used depicted graphic sexuality.
