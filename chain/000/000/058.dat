z2002
tThe Phred on Your Head Show was an American children's television series that aired from 1999 to 2002 on the Noggin television channel. On Saturdays and Sundays, it was 30 minutes; on weekdays, one hour. Each day, Big Voice gave Phred information about and the name of that episode's host and Phred would get out of his dot in Noggin.com, the channel's official website, and hop from head to head searching for the host. When Phred finally found the host, he told the "crew" or "boys" to "pickle" him/her and they were teleported into noggin.com, where Phred asked them what they wanted to do first. The Show Reruns as a current Phred on Your Head Show on U TV Channel and U on CNXD.
