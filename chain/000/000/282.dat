tOcean Girl is an Australian science fiction TV series aimed for family audiences and starring Marzena Godecki as the lead character. The show is set in the near future, and focuses on an unusual girl named Neri who lives alone on an island, and the friendships she develops with the inhabitants of an underwater research facility called ORCA. The show is an example of deep ecology science fiction.\n\nOcean Girl inspired an animated series, The New Adventures of Ocean Girl, which ran from 2000 to 2001, and has since been released on DVD. The animated series is in a distinct reboot separate from the original live-action show.
