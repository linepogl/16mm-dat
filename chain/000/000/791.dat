tPokerFace is an ITV game show, where one person is guaranteed to win Â£1,000,000. The show was created by Ant & Dec, who also host it.\n\nPokerFace, as implied by the title, is based on the bluffing aspect of poker games. The contestants do not necessarily need to get the questions right in order to win, and can bluff their way through the game and pressure their opponents into folding in order to win.\n\nThe show was originally going to be called The Con Test, but the name was changed just weeks before the show began. However, the Australian version is called The Con Test.\n\nSeries 1 of the show was aired nightly for 7 consecutive days. Starting with series 2, the show was moved to a Saturday prime-time slot, lasted for 7 weeks.
