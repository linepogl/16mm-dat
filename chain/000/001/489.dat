tJimmy Kimmel Live! is an American late-night talk show, created and hosted by Jimmy Kimmel and broadcast on ABC. The nightly hour-long show made its debut on January 26, 2003, following Super Bowl XXXVII. Jimmy Kimmel Live! is produced by Jackhole Productions in association with ABC Studios .\n\nFrom its premiere until February 4, 2011, the show aired at 12:05 am Eastern Time. The show then aired at Midnight Eastern Time starting February 7, 2011. On August 21, 2012, ABC announced that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would be moving 25 minutes earlier to 11:35 pm ET beginning on January 8, 2013, putting the show in direct competition with The Tonight Show, Late Show with David Letterman, The Colbert Report and Conan, while bumping Nightline to 12:35 am ET.\n\nContrary to its name, Jimmy Kimmel Live! no longer airs live; instead, it is taped at 4:30 pm Pacific Time on the day of broadcast. On rare occasions, though, it airs a special live edition, usually after major events like the Academy Awards ceremonies. Until 2009, new episodes aired five nights a week; from 2009 to 2012, the Friday episode was a rebroadcast of a recent episode. Starting with the January 2013 move, the Friday episode has been retitled Jimmy Kimmel Live! This Week, and airs highlights from the entire week of shows.
