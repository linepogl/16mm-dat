tThe New Fred and Barney Show is a 30-minute Saturday morning cartoon produced by Hanna-Barbera as a 1979 series revival of The Flintstones from February 3 to October 20, 1979 on NBC. The series marked the first time Henry Corden performed the voice of Fred Flintstone for a regular series.\n\nThese new episodes were composed of the traditional Flintstones cast of characters such as Fred and Barney's children Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm as toddlers, after having been depicted as teenagers on The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show on CBS in 1972; they returned to the form of teenagers on The Flintstone Comedy Show in 1980 on NBC. Some plots were familiar Flintstones stories while others consisted of new misadventures with witches and werewolves, as well as spoofs of late 1970s fads.\n\nSeven new episodes combined with reruns of The New Fred and Barney Show were broadcast on the package program Fred and Barney Meet the Thing and later on Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo.
