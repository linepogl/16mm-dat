tQTV is a New Zealand children's science-based multimedia series designed to engage young people in the world around them.\n\nThe series is fronted by the "Q Team", four young people with a passion for discovery and science. The Wellington-based team is Barnaby Fredric, Chelsie Crayford, Tess Devereux, and Paora Durie.\n\nEach week one of the team throws down a new scientific challenge and kids are encouraged to post their findings online, where further opportunities for exploration and participation abound.
