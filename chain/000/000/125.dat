tTo the Manor Born is a British sitcom that first aired on BBC1 from 1979 to 1981. A special edition appeared in 2007. Starring Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, the first 21 episodes and the 2007 special were written by Peter Spence, the creator, while the 1981 finale was written by Christopher Bond, the script associate. The title is a deliberate pun on the phrase "to the manner born," from Shakespeare's Hamlet\n\nIn To the Manor Born Penelope Keith, who had become famous for playing Margo Leadbetter in the suburban sitcom The Good Life, plays Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, an upper-class woman who, upon the death of her husband, has to move out of her beloved manor house. The manor is then bought by Richard DeVere, a nouveau riche millionaire supermarket owner originally from Czechoslovakia. DeVere and fforbes-Hamilton have a loveâ€“hate relationship which is eventually resolved in the 1981 finale, in which they marry. In the 2007 special they celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary.\n\nFrom the first series, the programme proved popular and it received high audience figures for many of its episodes, especially the series 1 finale, the most watched British television programme of the 1970s. In 2004, To the Manor Born came 21st in Britain's Best Sitcom, a public poll to find Britain's favourite situation comedy.
