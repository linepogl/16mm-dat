tBorn in\n1930, Jean-Luc Godard became acquainted, while at university, with Claude\nChabrol, Francois Truffaut, Eric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, forming part of a\ngroup of passionate young film critics writing in Cahiers du Cinéma, and\nfilm-makers devoted to exploring new possibilities in cinema.  A bout de\nsouffle (Breathless) (1959) was his first feature. Made on a shoe-string\nbudget, it was spontaneous, vibrant and ground breakingly original. From then\nuntil 1967/8 was loosely his first period when he made an astonishing number of\nfilms, sometimes 3 a year. From 68 Godard was very involved in political\nfilm-making, and then made a series of programmes for French TV in the mid and\nlate 70’s. With Sauve qui peut (la vie)\nor Slow Motion, Godard could be said\nto start a 3rd period through the 80’s. In the 90’s he started more\nformal experimentation, specifically with his long series Histoire(s) du Cinéma.  His films\nhave influenced film-makers as diverse as Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Jim\nJarmusch, Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino and Wong Kar-Wai.  His latest\nfilm, Film Socialisme, received its\npremiere at the Cannes Film Festival (Un Certain Regard) to great acclaim.\nJean-Luc Godard was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2010.
