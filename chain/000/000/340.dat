tWhat's Good For You is a Logie Award-winning Australian health and lifestyle television program that airs on the Nine Network. It investigates myths and fables concerning health and well being. Examples of myths investigated include "Does chocolate really cause pimples?", "Is there a cure for hiccups?" and "What foods produce the most flatulence?".\n\nThe show was initially broadcast as an ongoing series of 60 minute episodes in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, Nine announced plans to revise the format of the program in the form of stand alone specials, with the first broadcast in this format later that year. The series returned as an ongoing series, albeit in a 30 minute format, from 8 April 2009.
