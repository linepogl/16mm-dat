tThe Podge and Rodge Show is an Irish chat show, broadcast and produced by RTÉ, featuring the popular Podge and Rodge as hosts. For the first three seasons they were joined by Lucy Kennedy as a co-host but for the first half of the fourth season they were joined by guest hosts including Michelle Heaton, after Kennedy took insult to being called "every name under the sun from bisto to an ugly Gráinne Seoige". Following a mid-season hiatus, Caroline Morahan took on the role of permanent co-host in February 2009. The programme airs every Monday and Tuesday at 22:50 on RTÉ Two from February to April and from October to December with a hiatus during the summer months.
