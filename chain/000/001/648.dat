nWeekend Live
tWeekend Live was an American news/talk television program on Fox News Channel.\n\nThe program featured live news story updates from correspondents, analysis from a number of different regular contributors, interviews with newsmakers of the week, and regular subject specific segments. Compared to other programming on the network, it didn't feature a commentary segment, but does have regular one-minute "Fox Real Time" news recaps.\n\nBroadcast live from the network's Washington, D.C. studios from 2:00-4:00 p.m. Saturday and 12:00â€“2:00 p.m. Sunday ET, the show was hosted by Bret Baier. The show had been previously hosted by Tony Snow from 2002 until 2003 on both ends of the weekend, and from 2003 until his departure to join the White House, on Saturdays, followed by Brian Wilson.\n\nThe program ran as America's Election Headquarters, using that title during the 2008 presidential election campaign. The Weekend Live name was ultimately dropped altogether on November 5, 2008 and was retitled as America's News HQ.
