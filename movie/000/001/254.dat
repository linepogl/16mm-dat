tBack from a holiday in Spain, Lili, 19, finds that Loïc, her twin brother, has left the house following a row with their father. She disapproves of her parents' apparently light attitude and is particularly shocked by her father's reluctance to even talk about the event. Lili desperately waits for a phone call from Loïc but her brother shows no sign of life. It is not long before Lili falls into depression and her condition quickly deteriorates. She won't eat anymore and is about to die when, at long last, a postcard written and sent by Loïc brings her back to life...
