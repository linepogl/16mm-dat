tDays of our Lives is a daytime soap opera broadcast on the NBC television network. It is one of the longest-running scripted television programs in the world, airing nearly every weekday in the United States since November 8, 1965. It has since been syndicated to many countries around the world. It also rebroadcasts on SOAPnet with the most recent NBC episode airing weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m.. The series was created by husband-and-wife team Ted Corday and Betty Corday. Irna Phillips was a story editor for Days of our Lives and many of the show's earliest storylines were written by William J. Bell. The show was renewed through September 2014.\n\nDue to the series' success, it was expanded from 30 minutes to 60 minutes on April 21, 1975. Since that date, the mid-show bumper, featuring the phrase "We will return for the second half of Days of our Lives in just a moment", was aired with every episode and voiced by the series' original star, Macdonald Carey.\n\nThe series focuses on its core families, the Hortons and the Bradys. Several other families have been added to the cast, and many of them still appear on the show. Frances Reid, the matriarch of the series' Horton family remained with the show from its inception to her death on February 3, 2010. Suzanne Rogers celebrated 39 years on Days of our Lives this year, appearing on the show more or less since her first appearance in 1973. Susan Seaforth Hayes is the only cast member to appear on Days of our Lives in all six decades it has been on air.
