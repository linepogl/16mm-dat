tWorking men and women leave the Lumière factory, through the main gate, followed by a carriage drawn by two horses. It is often referred to as the first real motion picture ever made, although Louis Le Prince's 1888 Roundhay Garden Scene pre-dated it by seven years. Three separate versions of this film exist, this is the original "two horses" version.
