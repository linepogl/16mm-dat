tThunderbirds is a 1960s British science-fiction television series, created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, filmed by their production company AP Films and distributed by ITC Entertainment, which was produced using a mixed method of marionette puppetry and scale-model special effects termed "Supermarionation". Following the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls, Supercar, Fireball XL5 and Stingray, the series is set in the 21st century and follows the exploits of International Rescue, a secret organisation formed to save people in mortal danger with the help of technologically advanced land, sea, air and space vehicles and equipment, launched from a hidden base on Tracy Island in the South Pacific Ocean. The main puppet characters are multi-millionaire ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, the founder of International Rescue, and his five sons, who pilot the craft of the Thunderbirds fleet. Periodically re-aired since its original 1965â€“66 broadcast, Thunderbirds has influenced numerous TV programmes, films and advertisements, has been followed by three feature-length films and a stage play, and has inspired various merchandising campaigns.
