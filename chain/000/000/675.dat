z2006
tSorted is a BBC television drama series, first broadcast in July 2006 on BBC One and BBC HD. It was created by Danny Brocklehurst, who has also written Clocking Off, The Stretford Wives and Shameless. Sorted achieved 5 million viewers and was the only drama that year to grow week on week in the ratings. Despite this - and the largely good critical response - the BBC announced in October 2006 that it would not recommission the programme.\n\nThe name of the series has a double meaning - postal workers 'sort' mail for delivery and "sorted" is a common slang word for approval used in Manchester.
