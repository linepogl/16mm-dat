tRollergirls is a 2006 A&E Network reality show examining the personalities, antics and motivations of the women involved with the Austin, Texas Lonestar Rollergirls roller derby league. According to their website, the league was founded in 2001 and is run as a "skater-owned and operated" company. Variety reported on March 13, 2006 that A&E was canceling the show due to low ratings.\n\nThe five league teams, of about ten members each, are the Cherry Bombs, Hellcats, Holy Rollers, Putas Del Fuego and Rhinestone Cowgirls. Episodes were initially broadcast on Monday nights beginning on January 2, 2006, with repeated showings throughout the week. Rollergirls was produced by Gary and Julie Auerbach, the creators of MTV's Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County.
