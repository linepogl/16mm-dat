tEarly Edition is an American television drama series that aired on CBS broadcast network from September 28, 1996 to May 27, 2000. Set in the city of Chicago, Illinois, it follows the adventures of a man who mysteriously receives each Chicago Sun-Times newspaper the day before it is actually published, and who uses this knowledge to prevent terrible events every day. Created by Ian Abrams, Patrick Q. Page, and Vik Rubenfeld, the series starred actor Kyle Chandler as Gary Hobson, and featured many real Chicago locations over the course of the series' run. Despite fan efforts to save the show, it was cancelled in May 2000, and it began airing in syndication on Fox Family Channel that same month. Fan conventions about the show were held for multiple years, and CBS Home Entertainment later released the first and second seasons on the DVD format in the United States in 2008 and 2009. As of May 2012 Early Edition can be seen on TV Guide Network.
