tTwo Guys and a Girl is an American sitcom created by Kenny Schwartz and Danny Jacobson. It ran on ABC from March 10, 1998, to May 16, 2001. Eighty-one episodes were aired over four seasons.\n\nThe series stars Ryan Reynolds, Traylor Howard and Richard Ruccolo as the primary characters. The second season saw the arrival of two recurring characters, Johnny Donnelly and Ashley Walker.\n\nABC bounced the sitcom from midweek to Friday night, leading to a steep drop in ratings. After the show moved back to Wednesday to try to revive the show's flagging support for a two-week trial, the plug was pulled, and the series was cancelled in May 2001. The series finale was titled "The Internet Show", an hour-long episode in which the fans of the show voted on the outcome online. In the end, they chose to have Ashley become pregnant with Pete's child, as opposed to either of the other two female characters, or nobody, becoming pregnant.
