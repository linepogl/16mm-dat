tKorgoth of Barbaria is a pilot episode for what was originally planned as an American animated television series created by Aaron Springer, storyboard writer and director for Dexter's Laboratory, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and SpongeBob SquarePants. The pilot episode first aired in the United States on June 3, 2006 at 12:30 AM on Adult Swim. The pilot received mostly positive reviews.

Later events, including a formal petition to revive the show, would indicate that it was dropped before production began.
