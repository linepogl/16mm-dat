tEssence of Emeril is a Food Network show hosted by chef Emeril Lagasse.\n\nIn each episode, Emeril shares with his viewers some of his 'kicked-up' recipes, similar to those on Emeril Live, but with a far calmer demeanor and quieter tone, and usually without the trademark apron that has become his Emeril Live uniform starting with the 2000 season.\n\nOn some of the episodes, some of Emeril's friends/workers make an appearance. An example was when he invited three of his workers from his Homebase in Louisiana to cook up some healthy recipes.\n\nHis "Essence of Emeril" set has a wine cabinet, a built-in deep fryer, and other appliances. When he cooks with a specific ingredient he explains what it is and how it is made.
