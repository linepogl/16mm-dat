tBeauty and the Geek is a reality television series that is an international franchise, the U.S version is shown on The CW. It has been advertised as "The Ultimate Social Experiment" and is produced by Ashton Kutcher, Jason Goldberg and Nick Santora.\n\nThe premise of the show consists of a group of "Beauties" and a group of "Geeks" who are paired up to compete as couples for a shared $250,000 and other prizes. Each beauty lives together in a room with her geek during the course of the competition. There are challenges shown each episode, one testing the beauties on a primarily academic subject, and another that has the geeks competing in a more popular/social realm. The winners of the challenges select two teams to compete against each other in a pure "quiz show" type question and answer session: the team with fewer correct answers gets eliminated.
