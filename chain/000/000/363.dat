tLegends of the Hidden Temple is an action-adventure game show for children. The show centers around a temple that is "filled with lost treasures protected by mysterious Mayan temple guards". Kirk Fogg hosts and serves as the teams' guide, while Dee Bradley Baker announces and voices a talking Olmec Head who "knows the secrets behind each of the treasures in his Temple". Six teams of two children compete to retrieve one of the historical artifacts in the Temple by performing physical stunts and answering questions based on history, mythology, and geography. After three elimination rounds, only one team remains, who then earns the right to go through the Temple to retrieve the artifact within three minutes and win a grand prize.\n\nLegends of the Hidden Temple was produced by Stone Stanley Productions in association with Nickelodeon and was taped at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. It aired on Nickelodeon from September 11, 1993 to 1995 in its first-run and through February 28, 1999 in reruns. Reruns of the program aired on Nick GAS from 1999â€“2007, and occasionally on TeenNick. Legends of the Hidden Temple won a CableACE award in 1995 for Best Game Show Special or Series.
