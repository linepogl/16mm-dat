z2003
tThat's Genius! was a BBC children's television series originally shown on BBC One between 12 November 2003 and 17 December 2003. The program ran for one series. Earlier in 2003 CBBC announced a competition for children to send in their ideas for inventions. The competition attracted nearly 3000 entries of which a panel of judges chose the top five. These five inventions were then made into prototypes by experts. On 17 December 2003 viewers were invited to vote for their favourite invention and then the winner was announced live on BBC One. The winner won a behind the scenes tour at the Epcot Center. The show was presented by Angellica Bell, Kursty Groves and Steve Wilson.
