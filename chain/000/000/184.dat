tJeremiah is an American television series starring Luke Perry and Malcolm-Jamal Warner that ran on the Showtime network from 2002 to 2004. The series takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where most of the adult population has been wiped out by a deadly virus.\n\nDeveloped by Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski and executive produced by Straczynski and Sam Egan, the series is loosely based on Belgian writer Hermann Huppen's comic book series, Jeremiah. Aside from the names of the two main characters, the general personality of the protagonist, and the post-apocalyptic setting, there are no other similarities between the comics and the series.\n\nThe series ended production in 2003 after creative differences emerged between MGM and Straczynski. Episodes for the final half of the second season did not begin airing in the United States until September 3, 2004.\n\nThe series was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
