tThe Impressionable Jon Culshaw is a satire sketch show, starring the impressionist Jon Culshaw. A deal with ITV enabled Culshaw to make this while simultaneously starring in BBC Two's Dead Ringers. He also starred in another show, Alter Ego, which is also shown on ITV. The show ran for six episodes in just one series from 25 February to 31 March 2004.\n\nThe show has been criticised for having too many impressions, and as a result it was felt by some that Culshaw did not do some of the characters justice. This is unsurprising, as Culshaw's repertoire of impressions numbers over 350. Culshaw used most of the impressions that featured on Dead Ringers, but there were some new ones too. Some of the more notable impressions are those of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, George W. Bush and Trevor McDonald.\n\nSome of the characters impersonated also featured in person on the show, where they meet Culshaw, who is impersonating them, and they interview themselves. This idea first featured in Alter Ego.
