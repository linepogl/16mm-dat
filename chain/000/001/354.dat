nComic Relief Does The Apprentice
z2009
tComic Relief Does The Apprentice is a special celebrity version of British reality television series The Apprentice, produced to raise money for Comic Relief. The first edition aired in March 2007, and the second in March 2009. Five male celebrities and five female celebrities took part in the show to complete a designated task. The task in the 2007 edition was to run a fun fair. The show first aired on BBC One at 2100 GMT on 15 March 2007 and concluded on 16 March 2007 during the main Comic Relief programme. The first episode of the show received strong viewing figures of 6.72 million. It became the fifth most watched programme on BBC One that week. The show returned on 12 March 2009 for the Comic Relief 2009 event, where the woman's team triumphed. This would prove to be the final charity Apprentice series, in part because of the time needed each year to film the newly commissioned Junior Apprentice series.\n\nJust weeks before the show aired in early 2007, it was spoofed in the television programme Kombat Opera Presents The Applicants.
