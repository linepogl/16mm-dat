tPoint Pleasant is a television series that first aired on the Fox Network in January 2005. It was cancelled in March 2005 due to poor ratings.\n\nPoint Pleasant boasted many of the same crew behind the scenes as Fox's other shortly withdrawn series, Tru Calling. In fact, Point Pleasant received the greenlight just three days after production ceased on Tru Calling. 13 episodes were filmed, but due to poor ratings, Fox only aired episodes 1–8 in the United States. Episodes 9–11 aired in Sweden, all episodes appeared in New Zealand on back to back weekdays in mid-2007, all episodes aired in The Netherlands in 2008 and the last two episodes are included on the DVD release.\n\nMuch of the music featured in the series was replaced for the DVD release due to licensing issues.\n\nThe show's executive producer was Marti Noxon, who worked closely with Joss Whedon for several seasons on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. For this reason, Point Pleasant initially drew in many of that show's fans, but Point Pleasant had a distinct "soapy" flavor, more in the vein of shows like Melrose Place or The O.C. than Buffy. The resulting drop in viewership eventually led to the show's cancellation. However, advocates of the show point to its gothic tone, its tempered, surprisingly subtle use of special effects, and the potential of the overall plotline as solid reasons the show should have stayed on the air. The plots emphasized humanity's self-centeredness and cruelty to one another as primal reasons for evil.
