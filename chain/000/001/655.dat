tPBS NewsHour is an American evening television news program that is broadcast weeknights on the Public Broadcasting Service; the program is currently anchored by Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff, who also serve as its managing editors. The show is produced by MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, a company co-owned by former anchors Jim Lehrer and Robert MacNeil, and Liberty Media, which owns a 65% stake in the company.\n\nUnlike most current evening newscasts in the United States, each edition of the PBS NewsHour is one hour long. The program also runs longer segments than most other news outlets in the U.S. The PBS NewsHour is known for its in-depth coverage of the subjects involved, and avoids the use of sound bites, instead playing back extended portions of news conferences and holding interviews that last several minutes.
