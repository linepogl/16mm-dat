tThe Mary Whitehouse Experience was a British topical sketch comedy show produced by the BBC in association with Spitting Image Productions. It starred two comedy double acts - David Baddiel and Rob Newman, and also Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis, all of whom had graduated from Cambridge University. It was broadcast on both radio and television in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe show was named after Mary Whitehouse, a prominent campaigner against what she saw as a decline in television standards and public morality. She became the target of mockery in the UK for her attacks on series such as Till Death Us Do Part and Doctor Who. The BBC feared Whitehouse would initiate litigation for the use of her name in the show's title, and for a period the alternative title The William Rees-Mogg Experience was considered.
