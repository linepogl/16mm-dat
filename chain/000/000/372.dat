tAn American in Canada is a Canadian television sitcom that aired on CBC.\n\nThe show starred Rick Roberts as Jake Crewe, an American television news host who was forced, after beating up his station manager, to accept a job in Calgary, Alberta as the host of the lowest-rated morning news program in the city. The show found its comedy in Crewe's attempts to adapt to Canadian culture.\n\nAn American in Canada was loosely based on the real-life experiences of Jebb Fink, an American comedian who moved to Canada after marrying a Canadian woman, and did become a morning television host on CKAL, Calgary's A-Channel station.\n\nIt is also aired on Australia's The Comedy Channel with the title Frostbite, and is currently in syndication on Showcase in Canada and HDNet in the USA.
