tClangers was a popular British stop-motion animated children's television series of short stories about a family of mouse-like creatures who live on, and in, a small blue planet. They speak in whistles, and eat green soup supplied by the Soup Dragon. The programmes were originally broadcast by the BBC from 1969–1972.\n\nThe series was made by Smallfilms, the company set up by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin. Firmin designed the characters, and his wife knitted and "dressed" the Clangers. Music – which was often part of the story – was by Vernon Elliott.
