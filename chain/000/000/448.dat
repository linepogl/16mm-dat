The story revolves around a boy by called Patrick who, whilst playing on his computer, receives an invitation to take part on a TV game show called "Finders Keepers" through a store in a shopping arcade. He accepts the invitation and is sucked into another world where he is given clues to find missing treasures from his own world and take part in an interdimensional hunt.\n\nThe show aired on ABC TV and lasted for two series, each consisting of five episodes.\n\nMost of the shopping centre scenes were filmed at Northpark Shopping Centre in Prospect, Adelaide, South Australia, which has been heavily renovated since the airing of the show. Some scenes were filmed at Sefton Plaza directly across the road which remains largely unchanged. The show simply pretends both shopping centres are the same place. Other locations include Botanic Park and the Dry Creek salt pans.
