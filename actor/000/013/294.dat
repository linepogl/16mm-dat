tMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the largest and most powerful studio in  Hollywood when Gene Kelly arrived in town in 1941. He came direct from  the hit 1940 original Broadway production of "Pal Joey" and planned to  return to the Broadway stage after making the one film required by his  contract. His first picture for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was For Me and My Gal (1942) with Judy Garland.  What kept Kelly in Hollywood were "the kindred creative spirits" he  found behind the scenes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The talent pool was  especially large during World War II, when Hollywood was a refuge for  many musicians and others in the performing arts of Europe who were  forced to flee the Nazis. After the war, a new generation was coming of  age. Those who saw An American in Paris  (1951) would try to make real life as romantic as the reel life they  saw portrayed in that musical, and the first time they saw Paris, they  were seeing again in memory the seventeen-minute ballet sequence set to  the title song written by George Gershwin  and choreographed by Kelly. The sequence cost a half million dollars  (U.S.) to make in 1951 dollars. Another Kelly musical of the era, Singin' in the Rain  (1952), was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of  Congress for its National Film Registry. Kelly was in the same league as  Fred Astaire,  but instead of a top hat and tails Kelly wore work clothes that went  with his masculine, athletic dance style. Gene Kelly died at age 83 of  complications from two strokes on February 2, 1996 in Beverly Hills, Los  Angeles, California.
