tThe Love Boat is an American television series set on a cruise ship, which aired on the ABC Television Network from September 24, 1977, until May 24, 1986. The show starred Gavin MacLeod as the ship's captain. It was part of ABC's popular Saturday night lineup that included Fantasy Island until that show ended in 1984.\n\nThe original 1976 made-for-TV movie on which the show was based was itself based on the nonfiction book The Love Boats by Jeraldine Saunders, a real-life cruise director. Two more TV movies would follow before the series began its run.\n\nThe executive producer for the series was Aaron Spelling, who produced several successful series for ABC from the 1960s into the 1980s.\n\nIn 1997, the episode with segment titles "Hidden Treasure", "Picture from the Past", and "Ace's Salary" was ranked No. 82 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. The Love Boat ran for 10 seasons, including specials.
