nStars in Fast Cars
tStars in Fast Cars was a humorous motoring-themed celebrity game show, in which celebrities competed at motoring challenges, including recreating movie stunts and racing modified armchairs. The series was first broadcast on BBC Three, in 2005, and repeated on BBC One in 2006.\n\nAmong some of the more notable moments were Car Skittles; a stunt where the guests had to drive on to the back of a moving lorry, before letting them all drive a Ferrari â€“ with a bathtub of water attached to the back which they were not allowed to spill. They were asked to race in a variety of motor-esque machines, from the aforementioned armchairs to Formula 1 cars.\n\nThe final round of each show, between the two top-ranking guests, features the use of the car cannon in attempts to hit various things.\n\nThe show originated as a one-off special of the popular BBC Two show, Top Gear, and was produced, as were a number of other television specials, in aid of charity Comic Relief for Sport Relief in 2004. It was later turned into a series, presented by Dougie Anderson.
