tJayce and the Wheeled Warriors is a French/North American animated TV show which was first broadcast on September 16, 1985. It was produced by DIC Entertainment and animated by the Japanese animation studios Sunrise, Shaft, Studio Giants, Studio Look and Swan Production. The show, which extended to 65 thirty-minute episodes, was created to support Mattel's Wheeled Warriors toy line. The show has an ongoing plot. However, it does not have a finale, and thus the plot was left unresolved.\n\nThe show featured two duelling forces. The heroes are humans, called the Lightning League. They drive white and silver vehicles with assorted weaponry, and are led by teenager named Jayce. The villains are organic green vegetable-based creatures called the Monster Minds, who tend to take the shape of black and green vehicles. They travel via large green organic vines which can grow in and across interstellar space, and sprout seeds that rapidly grow into further Monster Minds. They are led by Saw Boss.
