tCollege Football Final is a one hour program totally devoted to college football and airs every Saturday night during the college football season. It was previously named College Gameday Final until 2006. It is seen at 12am ET on ESPN and lasts until 1am ET and the program re-airs at 7:30 or 8:00 am the next morning. It is similar to ESPN's Baseball Tonight, NBA Fastbreak, NFL Live, and College GameNight, except that it only appears once a week. The program breaks down the days' games with highlights of all the biggest games, analysis of the big stories and a look ahead to next weeks match ups. The program is presented in high definition on ESPN HD, except for the on site reports.\n\nThe host of College Football Final, since 1999, is ESPN sportscasting veteran Rece Davis. Joining Davis with analysis are College Football Hall of Fame Pittsburgh offensive lineman Mark May and head coach Lou Holtz. Davis, Holtz, and May also appear all day long during half time reports and College Football Scoreboard. Trev Alberts, who was a former analyst on the show, resigned after the 2004 season saying, he was tired of being second to the College GameDay gang all the time, Holtz later replaced him. Throughout the show they go live to the College GameDay site with Chris Fowler, Lee Corso, and Kirk Herbstreit to get their thoughts on the day that was.
