tTribe is a documentary television series co-produced by the BBC and the Discovery Channel, and hosted by former British Royal Marine Bruce Parry.\n\nIn each series, Parry visits a number of remote tribes in such locales as the Himalayas, Ethiopia, West Papua, Gabon and Mongolia, spending a month living and interacting with each society. While there, Parry adopts the methods and practices of his hosts, participating in their rituals and exploring their cultural norms. This often enables him to form personal bonds with the members of each tribe.\n\nParry tries to learn the basics of the tribe's language but is also accompanied by a translator.\n\nThe series is co-produced by BBC Wales and the Discovery Channel. A second series aired in July 2006 and the third began on 21 August 2007 on BBC Two, and ended on 25 September 2007. No further series have been made, though Parry's 2008 series, Amazon has a similar synopsis.\n\nParry was awarded the BAFTA Cymru "Best On-Screen Presenter" award in 2008 for his work on the 'Penan' Episode. A BAFTA Cymru "Best Camera: Not Drama" award was also awarded for Gavin Searle's work in the same episode.
