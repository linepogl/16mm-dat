z2007
tMitten im 8en was an Austrian TV soap/comedy series produced by the ORF which ran from May 10 to June 29, 2007. The title translates to "In the Middle of the 8th", referring to Vienna's Josefstadt.\n\nRepeatedly announced to be a core feature of the retuned programming by ORF's new management, the show received extremely bad ratings and devastating criticism from the start, and was thus cancelled in the middle of its first season.
