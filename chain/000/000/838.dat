nScotland Today
z2009
tScotland Today was a Scottish regional news programme covering Central Scotland, produced by STV Central. Despite its name suggesting a national remit, the programme was actually limited to stories around STV's Central Belt franchise. North Tonight covered STV's North Scotland region, until both programmes were renamed as STV News at Six in March 2009.
