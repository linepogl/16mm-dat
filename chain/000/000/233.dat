tWho Wants to Be a Superhero? was a reality show hosted by Stan Lee. Contestants dress up as comic book superheroes of their own invention. Each week, Lee challenges the contestants to represent what "superheroes are all about." One or more of the superheroes deemed the least deserving is eliminated per episode. The grand prize for the winning superhero is to have his or her character star in a Dark Horse Comics comic book written by Lee and appear in an original movie to be aired on the Sci Fi Channel. The winner also receives a trip for two to Universal Studios Florida to participate in the park's Parade of Superheroes.\n\nSeason 1 premiered on July 27, 2006 on the Sci Fi Channel. Season 2 premiered on July 26, 2007. Stan Lee and his partner Gil Champion refused to confirm or deny rumors of a third season; Champion, in a shared 2007 interview with iF Magazine, stated "I guess it's a little early." There has been no sign of a third season, so despite no official announcement, the show is believed cancelled. Stan Lee has also co-created a British children's version of the series.
