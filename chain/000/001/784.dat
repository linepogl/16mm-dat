tIn Case of Emergency is an American half-hour comedy television series shown on ABC in the United States. The series follows a group of high school acquaintances whose lives have not turned out as they hoped. It premiered on January 3, 2007 at 9:30pm and ended on April 11, 2007. The pilot episode was directed by Jon Favreau and the cast included Jonathan Silverman, David Arquette, Lori Loughlin, Kelly Hu, and Greg Germann.\n\nABC gave early renewal notices to several of its series on March 21, 2007 but In Case of Emergency was not one of them. Many believe this is due to being placed in the same time slot as "American Idol".\n\nOn April 12, 2007, ABC announced that the show had been officially cancelled leaving one episode unaired, which has since been broadcast internationally.
