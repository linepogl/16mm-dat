z1991
tStar Test was a British TV programme that ran from 1989 to 1991 on Channel 4. The show took an interview format, in which the guest "star" was seated facing directly to camera, questioned by an unseen voice. The topics discussed were chosen from an on-screen menu, after which the interviewee selected questions by number from an unseen list. The show was lampooned in two British comedy sketch shows; French and Saunders and Bo' Selecta!, the latter being some 12 years after Star Test ended.
