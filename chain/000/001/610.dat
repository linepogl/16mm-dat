nThe Beltway Boys
tThe Beltway Boys was an internationally syndicated American weekly television show. The title referred to the Capital Beltway — the circumferential freeway surrounding Washington, D.C. — and to the two journalists who hosted the show: Mort Kondracke and Fred Barnes. Airing initially in the United States on Saturday evenings at 6:00 pm ET on the Fox News Channel, the program was a weekly digest and discussion of political issues. The show was taped in Fox News' Washington studios on Fridays.\n\nTypically, the program began with three primary topics that Kondracke and Barnes discussed at length. It then looked at newsworthy events in the political lives of national leaders in its "Ups and Downs" segment, characterizing the events as positive for the individual or negative.\n\nFox News Channel cancelled the show in April 2009.
