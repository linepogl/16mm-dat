tThe Metal Hero Series is a genre of tokusatsu superhero TV series produced by Toei for Japanese television. The protagonists of the Metal Hero Series are androids, cyborgs, or humans that don metallic suits and are also referenced as "Henshin Heroes." Usually, the genre revolves around a technological theme where technology, in the right hands, can be used for the greater good.\n\nThe shows were produced by Toei from 1982 through 1999 in conjunction with their other Tokusatsu superhero shows, such as Kamen Rider and Super Sentai. Not only are some of them popular in Japan but also in several other countries like France, Brazil, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Additionally, in the 1990s, Saban Entertainment used some of the shows to produce programs similar to their Power Rangers series. Some of the Metal Hero Series spawned sequels, resulting in the genre developing sub-categories based mainly on space and police-related characters.
