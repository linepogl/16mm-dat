tttn was a 30 minute weekly Australian news program aimed at school-aged children produced and broadcast by Network Ten from 2004 to 2008. It presented current issues and events in a way that could be understood and further explored by its intended viewers.\n\nttn premiered on 3 February 2004. It was created in the wake of an outcry against the cancellation of Behind the News, a long running ABC TV program similar in objective to ttn that was axed for a time due to budget cuts. ttn itself was axed in December 2008 after five years on air following budgetary constraints.\n\nttn aired every Tuesday each week during the school year. Episodes were supplemented by features and activities printed weekly in News Limited newspapers.
