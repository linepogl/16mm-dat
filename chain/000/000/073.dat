tEver Decreasing Circles is a British situation comedy which ran on BBC1 for four series from 1984 to 1989.\n\nIt was written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, and reunited them with Richard Briers, the star of their previous hit show, The Good Life. It was much less brash than most situation comedies, and was more like a comedy-drama in places. This move into darker areas of comedy was continued with Briers's later series If You See God, Tell Him.
