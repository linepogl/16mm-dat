nJonny Briggs
tJonny Briggs is a Children's BBC television programme first broadcast in 1985. It revolves around the exploits of a young boy, the eponymous hero, his pet dog, Razzle, and his eccentric family members: Mam and Dad, older sister Rita and older brothers Albert and Humph. Another older sister is mentioned but never seen. The stories often centre on Jonny's school life, where he and his best friend Pam are constantly in battle with the dreadful twins Ginny and Josie.\n\nPreviously some of the Jonny Briggs books by Joan Eadington were read on Jackanory. In the books Jonny has two more older sisters - Pat and Sandra. Cast members included Richard Holian as Jonny, Leslie Schofield, and Sue Devaney. Based on a series of popular children's books by Joan Eadington, the programme is set in Middlesbrough, and was filmed in Bradford.\n\nThe theme tune "The Acrobat" composed by J A Greenwood in 1936 is considered synonymous with the series. The piece of music chosen for the programme was recorded by renowned trombonist Colin Buchanan.
