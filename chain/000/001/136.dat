nThe Blizzard of Odd
tThe Blizzard of Odd was an Irish comedy television programme broadcast on RTÉ, presented and written by Irish comedian Colin Murphy. The half-hour show was aired usually on Tuesday nights at 22:25 on the RTÉ Two channel.\n\nThe programme incorporated a number of segments such as Boggle Box, reviewing the week's television programmes, Made in Ireland, which features clips from various Irish B-movies. Also "reviewed" in comical fashion were bizarre cult material such as recurring favourites Vampyros Lesbos and the Leprechaun film series, plus other segments which varied from week to week.\n\nOn one occasion Murphy was reviewing Star Trek, in particular the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "The High Ground" However, he was unable to show any clips of it, as the episode was banned from broadcast in Ireland and the UK due to a positive reference to Physical force Irish republicanism. Murphy got round the ban by reading out the script of the offending scene, attempting to play both characters.\n\nWhile the show was very cheaply produced – the set for later seasons was simply a white backdrop onto which Murphy occasionally brought props – it remains a cult favourite among sections of the viewing public in Ireland. It is on an indefinite hiatus and hasn't aired since 2005. Although it has been removed from the RTÉ website, the show has yet to be formally cancelled or renewed, leaving it in a state of limbo.
