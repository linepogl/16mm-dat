tFrom Wikipedia\n\nÓlga Vladímirovna Baclanova, (19 August 1896 – 6 September\n1974) was a Russian-born actress and operatic singer, who achieved prominence\nduring the silent film era and was often billed under her last name only, as\nBaclanova, similarly to the surname only nomenclature assigned to fellow\ncountryman Nazimova.\n\nShe was billed as the "Russian Tigress" and\nremains most noted by modern audiences for portraying Cleopatra in Tod\nBrowning's horror movie Freaks (1932), which features a cast of actual carnival\nsideshow freaks.\n\nBaclanova first came to New York City with the 1925 touring\nproduction of the Moscow Art Theatre's Lysistrata. Though the rest of the\ncompany returned to Russia in 1926, she stayed to pursue career in the United\nStates. A statuesque blonde, Baclanova quickly established herself as a popular\nactress in American silent movies and achieved a notable success with The Docks\nof New York (1928), directed by Josef von Sternberg. Later that year, she also appeared\nin The Man Who Laughs as Duchess Josiana, the femme fatale love interest to\nConrad Veidt's disfigured hero.\n\nThe introduction of talking films proved difficult for\nBaclanova, as audiences did not respond to her heavy Russian accent. She no\nlonger secured leading roles, and was relegated to supporting parts. Her career\nwas in decline when she was offered the role of the cruel circus performer\nCleopatra in Tod Browning's film Freaks (1932) This horror movie, which\nfeatured actual carnival freaks, was highly controversial and screened only\nbriefly before being withdrawn. It would be 30 years before Freaks gained a\ncult following. The movie did not revive Baclanova's film career, which ended\nin 1943.\n\nBaclanova worked extensively on stage in London's West End\nand in New York, for about 10 years starting in the mid-1930s. In 1943 she\nappeared in "Claudia" at the Moore Theatre in Seattle, Washington.\n\nBaclanova was married three times and bore two sons with her\nfirst and second husbands. The birth of her second son with actor Nicholas\nSoussanin was front page news and covered quite extensively in the press in\n1930.\n\nAfter her retirement she settled in Vevey, Switzerland,\nwhere she died in 1974.
