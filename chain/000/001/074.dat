tTabitha is an American fantasy sitcom that aired during the 1977-1978 season on ABC. It is a spin-off of Bewitched, which had ended its run several years earlier. The series stars Lisa Hartman as Tabitha, Samantha and Darrin Stephens' daughter who was introduced on Bewitched during its second season.\n\nIn the series, Tabitha is portrayed as a 20-something production assistant living and working in Los Angeles. The supporting cast includes David Ankrum as Tabitha's brother Adam with whom she works, Robert Urich as an egomaniacal talk show host who is a sometime love interest for Tabitha, and Mel Stewart as Tabitha and Adam's cranky but loveable boss. Unlike Bewitched, which was hit for ABC and aired for eight seasons, Tabitha failed to catch on with viewers and was canceled after one season.
