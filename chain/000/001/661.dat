tSex, Love & Secrets is a television series that aired on UPN from September 27 to October 18, 2005. The show was created by Michael Gans and Richard Register. The program was announced as Sex, Lies and Secrets when UPN released the Fall schedule, but the title was changed two months later to replace Lies with Love.\n\nSex, Love & Secrets aired in the timeslot that belonged to Veronica Mars during the 2004–2005 television season; 9–10 p.m. on Tuesday nights. Unlike Veronica Mars, which had minor promotion and great reviews during its first season, Sex, Love & Secrets had neither advertising nor positive reviews behind it. As a result, when the show premiered on September 27, 2005, it garnered an embarrassing 1.2/2 rating. Next week the show improved slightly to a 1.5/2. At that point UPN pulled the show from production. UPN kept the show on for two more weeks, with it averaging a 1.3/2 in those two weeks. With six episodes left unaired, UPN took the show off its schedule entirely.\n\nThe show ended up rated 155th out of 156 shows in the 2005–2006 television season, barely outranking its timeslot replacement before Veronica Mars was shifted back to Tuesday nights for the rest of the season, Get This Party Started. The unaired episodes eventually aired during a two-year syndication run over the HD-exclusive Universal HD cable channel.
