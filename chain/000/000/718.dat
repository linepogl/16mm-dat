nBurgo's Catch Phrase
tBurgo's Catch Phrase was an Australian game show that ran between 1997 and 2003, produced by Southern Star Group for the Nine Network. The show was based on the British and American versions of the game, and was originally knowned simply as Catch Phrase until 1999 where the show was renamed as Burgo's Catch Phrase after the host in its honour. The show was cancelled three times in 1998, 2001 and 2003 after failing ratings despite a revamp of the set in 2002.\n\nContestants would have to identify the familiar phrase represented by a piece of animation, with the show's mascot — a character called "Jimmy" — often appearing. In the original run, two contestants played in each game, but in the 2002 revamp, this was increased to three.
