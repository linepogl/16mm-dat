tWhen beloved Chicago movie cameraman Allen Ross' personality dramatically changed and he mysteriously disappeared, his many filmmaking friends refused to give up on finding him. Their 4 year cross-country search and the hideous conspiracy they uncovered was made into this deeply personal documentary by his German friend and colleague Christian Bauer. Ross was a co-founder of Chicago Filmmakers.
