tFree 4 All is a short-lived Stone-Stanley game show hosted by Mark Walberg that aired on USA Network from June 27 to November 4, 1994. For its first month, it was paired with another Stone-Stanley game show Quicksilver which aired immediately before Free 4 All on the network's afternoon game show block. However, Free 4 All proved less successful and was cancelled after only four months and only Quicksilver remained until the network ended its game show block for good in October 1995.
