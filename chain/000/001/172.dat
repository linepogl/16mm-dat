nSaturday Primetime
tSaturday Primetime is an American television program that appears every Saturday during the college basketball regular season. It is the ESPN game of the week as part of College GameDay. Started in 2005, the game is featured wherever Rece Davis, Hubert Davis, Digger Phelps and Jay Bilas are for the college basketball version of College GameDay. The official name is Saturday Primetime presented by DirecTV. The previous title sponsor was Cisco Systems.\n\nThe game of the week airs every Saturday at 9 p.m. ET during the regular season with a one-hour pre-game show as part of College GameDay. The game is also seen in high definition on ESPNHD. Like Sunday Night Baseball, scheduling conflicts can result in the game being shown on ESPN2 and ESPN2HD. In 2005 and 2006, Brad Nessler had called play-by-play, but in 2007, Dan Shulman took over for Nessler along with college basketball guru Dick Vitale with color commentary and Erin Andrews with the sideline reports. Occasionally, Bilas and Bob Knight fill in for Vitale and join Shulman on the broadcast. Games are shown from a variety of conferences. Starting in 2013 Shannon Spake will serve as sideline reporter.
