tFalcon Beach is a Canadian television show, filmed at Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba, Canada, and produced for the Canadian and American markets. It originally aired in 2005 as a movie on Global in Canada. It was produced as a TV series for Global and ABC Family in 2006. It is also currently in first run showings internationally in several languages.\n\nFans organized an effort to save the show during mid-2007 that did not succeed.\n\nIt was unique among Canadian TV series in that the producers filmed two versions of each episode. The first was for Canada and uses Canadian geographic references and terminology. The second version was done for the United States and uses American geographic references and terminology.\n\nSet in the fictional resort town of Falcon Beach, Manitoba, the program is a teen drama similar in style to The O.C.\n\nAfter a stellar ratings debut, numbers for the program slipped after Global moved the program around its schedule multiple times. Despite the declining ratings, Global renewed the series for an additional 13-episodes.\n\nSeason 2 aired on Fridays at 8pm. The season premiere aired January 5, 2007 on Global.\n\nFalcon Beach aired first run episodes in the U.S. on ABC Family throughout the summer of 2006. The second season on ABC Family aired in the summer of 2007.
