nStorybook Squares
z1977
tStorybook Squares is a short-lived Saturday morning version of Hollywood Squares for children. The primary difference, apart from having children as contestants, was that it featured celebrities in costume as well-known fictional characters and some as historical figures.\n\nAs with the adult version, Peter Marshall was host and Kenny Williams was announcer; Williams read the characters' names off a scroll as "The Guardian of the Gate", a role similar to his "Town Crier" on Video Village.\n\nThe series originally ran on NBC from January 4 to April 19, 1969, with repeats airing until August 30.
