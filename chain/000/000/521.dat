tFetch! with Ruff Ruffman, sometimes shortened as Fetch!, is a children's television series for children ages 6â€“12 on PBS during the PBS Kids Go! block of educational programming. It is a game show/reality show that is hosted by an animated anthropomorphic dog named Ruff Ruffman who dispenses challenges to the show's real-life contestants. The series ran for five seasons and 100 episodes from May 29, 2006 to November 4, 2010 on PBS, with 30 contestants in that time. In June 2010, WGBH announced that the series would end due to lack of funding. In June 2008, the series received its first Emmy for Best Original Song for its theme.
