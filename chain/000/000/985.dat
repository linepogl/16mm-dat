tWacky Races is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera. The series, inspired by the 1965 slapstick comedy film The Great Race, features 11 different cars racing against each other in various road rallies throughout North America, with each driver hoping to win the title of the "World's Wackiest Racer." Wacky Races ran on CBS from September 14, 1968, to January 4, 1969. Seventeen episodes were produced, with each episode featuring two different races.\n\nThe cartoon had an unusually large number of regular characters, with twenty-three people and animals spread among the 11 race cars. Reruns of the series currently air several times a day on Cartoon Network's classic animation network Boomerang.
