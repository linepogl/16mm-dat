tWatercolour Challenge was a daytime television programme broadcast in the United Kingdom. It was presented by Hannah Gordon and directed by Tim Conrad and was shown on Channel 4 from 1998 to 2001.\n\nIn the programme, three amateur artists were given four hours to paint, in watercolour, the same scene or landscape, often with widely different interpretations. At the end of the four hours, the guest professional artist for the week judged the paintings and selected the winner, who would then appear in a regional final, and if successful would compete in the end of series final.\n\nThe guest artist also had a segment where they provided tips for the viewers to improve their painting technique.\n\nThe locations of each landscape painted changed in each episode, with various regions of both Great Britain and Ireland being visited, as well as a special show from Provence. The 2001 final was held in Tuscany.\n\nExpert art judges included the artists Jason Bowyer, Mike Chaplin, Annette Kane, Hazel Soan, and Jenny Wheatley. In 1999, Timmy Mallett was a regional judge for one episode of the show. A celebrity edition was produced, including Bill Oddie and Phillip Franks. The show was briefly presented by Cherie Lunghi when Hannah Gordon was unable to do so due to illness.
