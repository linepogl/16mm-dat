nTom Green's House Tonight
z2012
tTom Green's House Tonight was a Internet-based talk show hosted by Tom Green. In addition to its primary broadcast on TomGreen.com, the show was syndicated on television stations throughout North America. Green often refers to his show as, "The highest rated, longest running, and only talk show on the Internet."\n\nThe webcast is mostly spontaneous with a reliance on celebrity guests and viewer interaction via Skype calls and phone calls. The show is set inside Green's living room in the Hollywood Hills, where a fully functional low-budget studio has been constructed.\n\nBeginning February 4, 2013, Green replaced Tom Green's House Tonight with Tom Green Radio, a weekly audio podcast recorded in a Hollywood studio. As of October 3, 2013, Tom Green Live will return to television with a weekly broadcast on AXS TV.
