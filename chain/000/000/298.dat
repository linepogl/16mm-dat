nMel and Joey
z2011
tMel & Joey is a Filipino television talk and lifestyle show that airs every Sunday evenings by GMA Network.\n\nIt replaced the previous talk show, Partners with Mel Tiangco, where Mel Tiangco hosted when Jay Sonza ran for election to the Senate of the Philippines under the party, Aksyon Demokratiko, and moved to UNTV 37 as station manager. He later moved to the radio anchor of DZIQ. On August 15, 2010, aside from birthday of Mel Tiangco, the new intro of Mel & Joey is unveiled.\n\nTo date, its last episode in the studios was on February 6, 2011. Afterwards, the show has been at a designated venue and that's where the show would take place.\n\nAfter 7 years on air, GMA decided to cancel it for an unknown reason. The show is well-received and has a lot of commercials, so the reason is to give way to a planned talent show that would compete with other rival networks
