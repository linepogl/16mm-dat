tDog Town and Z-Boys follows the evolution of skateboarding from the 60's and into the late 70's as skateboarding's california beach boy image is transformed into a low-riding surf oriented style. Dog Town is a documentary of the group of surfers in Venice Beach, California and how flat waves and a need for something more extreme lead to the verticle era of the sport.
