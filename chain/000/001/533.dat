tCaméra Café is a French-born concept of comedy television series exported around the world. A movie spin-off has been made in France under the title of Espace détente. It was originally a French television show created by Bruno Solo, Yvan Le Bolloc'h, and Alain Kappauf and it was broadcast from September 2001 to December 2003 on the M6 channel.\n\n700 episodes of 3 minutes each have been produced and were broadcast again on M6 in 2004. The show revolves around a dysfunctional office. Its originality stems from the fact that, within the fiction, the camera is fixed into the automated coffee machine of the office space.\n\nThe title is a French pun on "Caméra Cachée",.
