nNightline
z2010
tNightline was a late-night news bulletin produced by Nine News. Introduced in 1992, it was axed in 2008 then brought back in 2009 and it was axed again in July 2010. It aired at around 11.30 pm weeknights, but was not shown in Perth or Adelaide. Nightline was previously presented by Kellie Connolly. Its main competitors were Ten Late News and ABC News's Lateline - which both air prior to Nightline at 10:30pm\n\nThe series was patterned after the version that airs on ABC, but that one is different from the Australian counterpart even though at one point both versions used the same opening graphics, which both no longer use.
