It was created and hosted by Jerry Bryant in 1984, who today remains a vital aspect in the production and post-production of the show's recent reformatting. As of the show's 27th Season, Jerry Bryant and Ryan Manno are the show's main hosts, co-hosted by Jenna Martinelli, Brendan Kelly, Nicole Marsel, Jamal Neff, Tanner Rittenhouse, and Tobias Jeg.\n\nThe show is broadcast nationally on NBC's 'Nonstop' channel Saturday nights at 10pm and also posts all of its aired content on its website, JBTV Online.
